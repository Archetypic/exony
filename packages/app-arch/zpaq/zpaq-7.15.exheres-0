SUMMARY="Journaling incremental deduplicating archiving compressor"
DESCRIPTION="
ZPAQ is based on the PAQ context mixing model, which was developed over the period 2000-2009. A set
of context models independently predict the next bit of input. Then the predictions (probabilities)
are combined and used to arithmetic code the bit. Using lots of predictors improves compression but
takes more time.
