SUMMARY="A c++ binding for FUSE... makes implementing virtual filesystems peace of cake!"
DESCRIPTION="
fusekit is an object oriented c++ binding of FUSE. While FUSE provides a great c api / library which
enables you to implement full-featured filesystems in userspace, it still requires some work to get
things up and running. On top of FUSE, fusekit has been designed to ease this task. In opposite to
the FUSE api, fusekit's api reflects a filesystem's hierarchical nature as it provides concepts of
directories and files. fusekit is header-only and highly customizable through the usage of template
techniques.
