SUMMARY="Generic finger-tree structure, with example instances"
DESCRIPTION="
A general sequence representation with arbitrary annotations, for use as a base for implementations
of various collection types, with examples, as described in section 4 of Ralf Hinze and Ross
Paterson, \"Finger trees: a simple general-purpose data structure\", Journal of Functional
Programming 16:2 (2006) pp 197-217.  http://staff.city.ac.uk/~ross/papers/FingerTree.html

For a tuned sequence type, see Data.Sequence in the containers package, which is a specialization of
this structure.
