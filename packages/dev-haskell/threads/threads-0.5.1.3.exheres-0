SUMMARY="Fork threads and wait for their result"
DESCRIPTION="
This package provides functions to fork threads and
wait for their result, whether it's an exception or a
normal value.

Besides waiting for the termination of a single thread
this packages also provides functions to wait for a
group of threads to terminate.

This package is similar to the
threadmanager, async and spawn packages.
The advantages of this package are:

* Simpler API.

* More efficient in both space and time.

* No space-leak when forking a large number of threads.

* Correct handling of asynchronous exceptions.

* GHC specific functionality like forkOn and forkIOWithUnmask.
