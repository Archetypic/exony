SUMMARY="Binding to the GLIB library for Gtk2Hs."
DESCRIPTION="
GLib is a collection of C data structures and utility functions
for the GObject system, main loop implementation, for strings and
common data structures dealing with Unicode. This package only binds
as much functionality as required to support the packages that
wrap libraries that are themselves based on GLib.
