SUMMARY="Tools to build the Gtk2Hs suite of User Interface libraries."
DESCRIPTION="
This package provides a set of helper programs necessary to
build the Gtk2Hs suite of libraries. These tools include
a modified c2hs binding tool that is used to generate
FFI declarations, a tool to build a type hierarchy that
mirrors the C type hierarchy of GObjects found in glib,
and a generator for signal declarations that are used
to call back from C to Haskell. These tools are not needed
to actually run Gtk2Hs programs.
