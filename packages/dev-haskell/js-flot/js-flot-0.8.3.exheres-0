SUMMARY="Obtain minified flot code"
DESCRIPTION="
This package bundles the minified Flot code (a jQuery plotting library) into a Haskell package, so
it can be depended upon by Cabal packages. The first three components of the version number match
the upstream flot version. The package is designed to meet the redistribution requirements of
downstream users (e.g. Debian).
