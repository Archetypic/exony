SUMMARY="Raw string literals for Haskell."
DESCRIPTION="
A quasiquoter for raw string literals - that is, string literals that don't recognise the standard
escape sequences (such as '\\n'). Basically, they make your code more readable by freeing you from
the responsibility to escape backslashes. They are useful when working with regular expressions,
DOS/Windows paths and markup languages (such as XML).
