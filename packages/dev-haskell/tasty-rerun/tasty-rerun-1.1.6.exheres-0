SUMMARY="Run tests depending on the result of previous test runs"
DESCRIPTION="
This ingredient adds the ability to run tests by first filtering the test tree based on the result
of a previous test run. For example, you can use this to run only those tests that failed in the
last run, or to run only tests that have been added since tests were last ran.
