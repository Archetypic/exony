SUMMARY="Checks and undeletes partitions + PhotoRec, signature based recovery tool"
DESCRIPTION="
TestDisk is powerful free data recovery software! It was primarily designed to help recover lost
partitions and/or make non-booting disks bootable again when these symptoms are caused by faulty
software, certain types of viruses or human error (such as accidentally deleting a Partition Table).
Partition table recovery using TestDisk is really easy.
PhotoRec is file data recovery software designed to recover lost files including video, documents
and archives from hard disks, CD-ROMs, and lost pictures (thus the Photo Recovery name) from digital
camera memory. PhotoRec ignores the file system and goes after the underlying data, so it will still
work even if your media's file system has been severely damaged or reformatted.
