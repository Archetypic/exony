SUMMARY="the blessed package to manage your versions by scm tags"
DESCRIPTION="
setuptools_scm is a simple utility for the setup_requires feature of setuptools for use in Mercurial
and Git based projects.

It uses metadata from the SCM to generate the version of a project and is able to list the files
belonging to that project (which makes the MANIFEST.in file unnecessary in many cases).
